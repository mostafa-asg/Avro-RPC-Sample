# Avro-RPC-Sample

This is a simple RPC implementation using [Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org/).The sample consist of 3 maven modules: 
  * Protocol
  * Server
  * Client

## Protocol
The protocol is an interface that server and client must be agree on.This module contains an avro protocol using Json 
in src/main/avro.In this file we defined a protocol named "Calculator"
which has 4 methods : add,subtract,multiply and divide.
Then using Avro Maven Plugin in pom.xml file we generate code for this protocol.The generated code is a java interface that has 
4 methods(add , subtract , ...).The Server must implement this interface.

## Server
The server implement Calculator interface that has been generated by Avro Maven Plugin.When you start the server,
you must provide listening port number via program arguments.When the server has been started then you must run the client.

## Client
The client connects to server and call methods on server.You must provide the server port via program arguments.
The result of method calls is written to standard output.
